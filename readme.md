# Development of a web-based application for testing children's cognitive abilities based on the Kaufman test

The web-based application, available to absolutely everyone, can help parents detect potential problems in their children's development in a timely manner and take steps to correct them.

The Kaufman test is based on the Cattell-Horn-Carroll (CHC) theory of cognitive abilities, which posits that intelligence is comprised of a number of different abilities, such as fluid reasoning, crystallized intelligence, and visual processing. The Kaufman test has been extensively researched and validated, and is considered to have a strong scientific basis. It has been shown to be reliable and valid in a variety of populations, including children with learning disabilities and gifted children.
