  fullText: `In today's society, more and more attention is being paid to child
    development and education. One of the most important aspects of a
    child's development is the assessment of his or her cognitive abilities,
    which determine future academic and career success. One of the most
    well-known and widely used tools for assessing the cognitive abilities
    of children is the Kaufman test. The Kaufman test is a psychological
    diagnostic test for assessing cognitive development. Its design
    incorporates several recent developments in psychological theory and
    statistical methodology. The test was developed by Alan S. Kaufman and
    Nadine L. Kaufman in 1983 and revised in 2004. The test has been
    translated and accepted in many countries.`,
