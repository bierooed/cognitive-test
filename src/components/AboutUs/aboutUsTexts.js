  fullText: `In today's society, more and more attention is being paid to child
    development and education. One of the most important aspects of a
    child's development is the assessment of his or her cognitive abilities,
    which determine future academic and career success. One of the most
    well-known and widely used tools for assessing the cognitive abilities
    of children is the Kaufman test. The Kaufman test is a psychological
    diagnostic test for assessing cognitive development. Its design
    incorporates several recent developments in psychological theory and
    statistical methodology. The test was developed by Alan S. Kaufman and
    Nadine L. Kaufman in 1983 and revised in 2004. The test has been
    translated and accepted in many countries.`,

    "The Kaufman test is based on the Cattell-Horn-Carroll (CHC) theory of cognitive abilities, which posits that intelligence is comprised of a number of different abilities, such as fluid reasoning, crystallized intelligence, and visual processing. The Kaufman test has been extensively researched and validated, and is considered to have a strong scientific basis. It has been shown to be reliable and valid in a variety of populations, including children with learning disabilities and gifted children. However, like any psychological assessment tool, the KABC should be used in conjunction with other sources of information, such as interviews with parents and teachers, to provide a comprehensive understanding of a child's strengths and weaknesses.
